            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Business is the practice of making one's living or making money by
                producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). It is also "any activity or
                enterprise entered into for profit."

                Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner
                of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquires
                debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow
                for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Finance is a field that deals with the study of money and investments.
                It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of
                uncertainty and risk.[20] In the context of business and management, finance deals with the problems of
                ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its operational and financial objectives;
                i.e. that it. has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses, and can service
                both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments. Finance also deals with
                the long term objective of maximizing the value of the business.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">The Key to Success is Marketing</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Digital marketing is the component of marketing that uses the Internet
                and online based digital technologies such as desktop computers, mobile phones and other digital media
                and platforms to promote products and services.[2] Its development during the 1990s and 2000s changed
                the way brands and businesses use technology for marketing. As digital platforms became increasingly
                incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life, and as people increasingly use digital devices
                instead of visiting physical shops, digital marketing campaigns have become prevalent, employing
                combinations of search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing,
                influencer marketing, content automation, campaign marketing, data-driven marketing, e-commerce
                marketing, social media marketing, social media optimization, e-mail direct marketing, display
                advertising, eâ€“books, and optical disks and games have become commonplace.</p>
